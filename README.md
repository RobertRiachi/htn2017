Log(me) focuses on the improving mental health by providing two services.

One, an on-demand therapy chat service where chats are powered by trained volunteers, certified therapists or suicide hotlines, to provide users with both anonymity and convenience of the environment.

The second feature of **Log(me)** is its smart journal. Each login, the user is prompted to record a quantitative representation of their day (in the form of emotes) as well as the option of jotting down specific events. Log(me) then uses sentiment analysis to parse through the text and trends in the timeline, to provide prompts and suggestions for the user. For example, if the user has constantly been feeling "Sad" with words such as "anxiety" or "depression", Log(me) will prompt them to enter a queue to speak to a therapist.
